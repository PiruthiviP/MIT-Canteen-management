# Project Overview
MIT Canteen Billing System using UPI Payment Introduction
The MIT Canteen Billing System is a software tool designed to make managing sales and inventory at a canteen easier. It speeds up the checkout process, manages items efficiently, and keeps track of customer details.
# Features
## 1. BillingPage:
• Allows students and staffs to select items, enter quantities, and generate
bills. The interface is user-friendly and facilitates quick transaction
processing.
## 2. InventoryManagement:
• Enables users to add or remove items from the inventory, keeping the billing page updated with the available items.
## 3. CustomerDetails:
• Stores and manages customer information to improve service and maintain
records. 4. SalesTracking:
• Tracks all sales transactions to aid in inventory management and planning. 5. Settings:
• It Provides options to adjust system settings based on the canteen’s needs. Technical Details
#  Language:
• C++ with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
 # Compiler:
• Compatible with both Windows and Unix systems
• Date and Time:
• Automatically updates the date and time for each transaction. The order
number is also updated automatically. • Interface:

• Utilizes a simple text-based interface, making it easy for staff to use without requiring extensive training.
# Disadvantages
• User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):
• Currently limited to a text-based interface. Future improvements could
include a more interactive UI/UX. • Bank Authorization:
• Lacks actual bank authorization for UPI payments. So i freeze the QR code remains active for one minute, then automatically it will generate the bill.
 # Future Plans
• Website Development:
• Plans to create a website to integrate this technology for MIT students,
expanding its functionality and accessibility.
